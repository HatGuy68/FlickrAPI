#Python Automation (Task1)


###TASK 1:  API testing via Postman and automating via Python

Flicker's API documentation is https://www.flickr.com/services/api/ . Please read it carefully, signup for a free flicker account to get your own authentication key. You have to understand, call and use these one/two Flickr APIs (preferably using Postman as that is a de-facto software for API calling).

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.blogs.postPhoto.html (OPTIONAL, extra bonus points - requires Oauth authentication too)

####Note :

Provide a ~2 mint screen recorded video of calling these two APIs (using postman) with audio explaining what you are doing.

- Explain your detailed understanding of the HTTP call and JSON response.
- What are the most important fields/failure points in the response?
- If you were to automate this APIâ€™s response testing as a Flickr employee, what is/are the criteria(s) you would choose as the success/fail validations?
- PS: Extra points/preference, if you end up automating the API call using python (using requests library) and validating the response.
